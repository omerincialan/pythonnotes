# Hi my name is Omer Incialan. I will write a program that reads from 
# a file which includes a list of teams that won the World Series Champions
# In the list it is provided the first year of championship and some 
# exceptional years in which there was no championship games.
# With the program I will create a dictionary of winner team and year that team won. 
# With the dictionary i create, I will write a program that takes year as 
# input and return the winner of that year as output.


# Here I define the first function to read from the file 'WorldSeriesWinnners'
# So far we know the first year of the championship and years in which no game took place.
