------ Test stack ------

Successful test: handled popping empty s1: Pop failed - stack is empty
Successful test: rejected due to type incompatibility: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'should not be allowed into an int stack'
Failed test: expected push() to reject due to type incompatibility but it didn't

 due to use of numpy array instead of stack ----

Homogeneity Example: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'string'
Fixed Size Example: Push failed - capacity reached
