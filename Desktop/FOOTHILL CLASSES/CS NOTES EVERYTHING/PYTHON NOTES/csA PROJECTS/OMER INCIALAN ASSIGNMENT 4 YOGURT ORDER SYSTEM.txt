### Hello my name is OMER INCIALAN. 
### This is a program to interact with customers buying yogurt. For each yogurt they 
### buy, program will add 1 point to customer's balance. When customer has points (Stamps) 
### equal to  or more than a certain number (12, in this case), 
### customer will be presented the option to use points they have for a free yogurt.
### I used an infinite while loop with three parts. The first part is for Purchase, 
### The second part is for Shut down, and the one for reminding valid entry options.

FREE_YOG_NUM = 12 # The number of stamps required to win a free yogurt
num_stamps = 0 # Initialize customer's stamp balance

# Main (Infinite) Loop
while True:
    # Menu
    print("Menu:")
    print("  P (Process Purchase)")
    print("  S (Shut down)")

    # Customer Action (converting each input into lowercase)
    user_choice = input("\nYour Choice: ").lower()

    # Process Purchase
    #This is the first part of the main loop structure
    if user_choice.startswith('p'):
        num_yogurts_input = int(input("How many yogurts do you want? "))
        
        # Check if the input can be converted to an integer and if it's greater than 0
        if num_yogurts_input > 0:
            num_yogurts = num_yogurts_input
            num_stamps += num_yogurts # Track and keep the number of stamps earned
            
            # Display number of stamps earned at the current transaction and total stamps earned so far
            print(f"ENJOY YOUR YOGURTS!!! \nYou just earned {num_yogurts} stamps and have a total of {num_stamps} to use.\n")
            
            # Check if the customer qualifies for a free yogurt
            if num_stamps >= FREE_YOG_NUM:
                print('CONGRATULATIONS!!! You qualify for a free yogurt.')
                print('Remember every 12 points qualify for a free yogurt :)')
                # Award Processing Transaction
                award_choice = input("Would you like to use your credits? (Y or N) ").lower()
                if award_choice.startswith('y'):
                    # Calculation and informing the customer about existing stamps for a free yogurt
                    num_stamps -= FREE_YOG_NUM
                    print("Enjoy your free yogurt!")
                    print(f"You now have {num_stamps} stamps remaining.\n")
                elif award_choice.startswith('n'):
                    print("*** Thank you for shopping with us \n see you next time! ***\n")
                else:
                    print("*** Invalid choice. Please enter Y or N. ***\n")
        else:
            print("*** Invalid entry. Please enter a valid positive number. ***\n")

    # Shut down the order management and award processing system
    # This is the second part of the main loop structure.
    elif user_choice.startswith('s'):
        print("Shutting down the system. Goodbye!")
        break

    #Invalid choice 
    #This is the 3rd part of main loop structure, when user performs an ionvalid entry
    else:
        print("*** Invalid Entry. Press P or S, please. ***\n")
