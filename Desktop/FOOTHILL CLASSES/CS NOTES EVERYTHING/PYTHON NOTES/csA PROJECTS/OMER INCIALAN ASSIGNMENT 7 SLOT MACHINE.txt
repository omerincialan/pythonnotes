# Hello my name is Omer Incialan. In this program I simulate a slot machine. 
# When user enters a bet amount, they initiate a pull, and receive results 
# based on predefined criteria. Combinations like three cherries or three BARs yield winnings.
# The game continues until the user decides to quit. It utilizes a helper class, 
# functions for user input, pull simulation, and result determination.
# After receiving a bet amount from the user as input, this program will do 
# 2 main things. 
# Based on certain conditions, program will pay back the bet amount by 
# multiplying it or user will lose the entire bet amount.


# We import build in libraries first.
import random



# First created a class to generate objects in the form of strings. 
class MultipleString:
    def __init__(self, string1, string2, string3):
        # Initialize a MultipleString object with three strings
        self.string1 = string1
        self.string2 = string2
        self.string3 = string3

# Here we have this function to serve as both inout and output communicator.
# We will use the valid input to calculate the payout amont in the times of wins
# With a while loop we keep asking for bet until our user runs out of money
# inside the loop, we check the validity of input character type and amount

def get_bet():
    
    MIN_BET = 0
    MAX_BET = 50
    
    while True:
     bet_input = input("How much would you like to bet (1 - 50) or 0 to quit? ")

         bet = int(bet_input)
         if MIN_BET <= bet <= MAX_BET:

# The data of the MultipleString object will be filled with three randomly 
# chosen strings according to the probabilities described in the "Understand 
# the Application" section.

# This helper method is one of the core components of this slot machine. 
# We are determining how often can a user win under what probability. We could leave some probabilistic
# represantation completely out of reach and leave very very little chance of winning to user.
# however in this program we define and use all of possible outcomes as requested by the assignment
# We used random number generator built in function of python. we generate 
# a "ramdom" number between 0 and 5000 and convert it to a probability percentage between 0 and 100.
# the reason I sed "" for random above is, as far as I know this function is not completely random, but 
# tries to avoid using recently picked numbers
